# Tic-Tac-Toe Chess

A simple game inspired by chess and tic-tac-toe developed with **Pygame**. This is a logic and strategy game for two players, based on chess movements in a tic-tac-toe board.

## 🕹 How to Run

Make sure you have **Python 3** and **Pygame** installed.

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

Then, run the game with:

```bash
python3 Menu.py
```

## 🎯 Objective

The game ends in one of two ways:
- A player aligns **three of their pieces** vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- A player has **no valid moves** left — that player loses the game.

## 🧩 Game Rules

1. **Initial Placement Phase**:
   - Each player takes turns placing their pieces on the board.
   - The placement continues until all pieces are on the board.

2. **Movement Phase**:
   - Once all pieces are placed, players alternate turns.
   - Each piece moves **according to its type**, using standard chess rules (e.g., bishops move diagonally).
   - **Capturing is not allowed** — players cannot remove opponent pieces.


Good luck and have fun!
